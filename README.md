For these projects, I worked on managing and organizing course data for the Computer Science program. In the first project, I analyzed the run-time and memory usage of different data structures like vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. Then, in the second project, I wrote code that sorts and prints the course list in alphanumeric order.

I approached the problem by learning how each data structure works and what makes them efficient or not. Understanding data structures is really important because it helps me choose the best way to handle data depending on the situation, especially when working with larger sets of information. For example, hash tables are great for quick searches, while binary search trees help keep data sorted automatically.

I ran into some challenges along the way, like handling collisions in hash tables and figuring out how to sort complex data correctly. I overcame these by breaking down problems into smaller steps, reading documentation, and testing my code bit by bit. Taking breaks and coming back fresh also helped me work through tougher issues.

These projects expanded the way I design software by making me more aware of how important data structures are in both performance and organization. I learned that the way I store and manage data directly impacts how well the program runs and how easy it is to maintain.

My coding style has changed too. I now put more effort into writing clear, readable code with good naming and comments. I also focus on making my code flexible so itâ€™s easier to update and adapt in the future. Overall, these projects helped me build a stronger foundation in algorithms and data structures, which I know will be really useful in my software development career.
